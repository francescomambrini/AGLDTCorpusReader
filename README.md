# Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank Corpus Reader

A Python-NLTK-like corpus reader for XML files that comply to the formats used by Perseus' 
Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank.

It *should* work with files from all related projects (Pedalion, Gorman Trees, 
Daphne, Sematia...). Test is needed, however.
